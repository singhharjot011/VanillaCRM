# Welcome to **ClientFlow CRM!**

This CRM is designed to help you manage your clients and tasks efficiently. Our key features include:

- **Dashboard:** Simplified to focus on its role as a central hub.
- **Client Management:** Streamlined to emphasize tracking clients and differentiating between all clients and assigned clients.
- **Calendar:** Made concise while still highlighting the main function of viewing appointments and tasks.
- **Tasks and Cases:** Combined the key points into a clear description of managing work and scheduling appointments.

## Workflow

This CRM is highly flexible and can be customized to suit various types of businesses. Currently, it is configured specifically for an immigration consultancy agency. Let's take a quick look at how it works:

- **Creating Clients:** Consultants add every potential customer as a lead by Adding Client via form available on [Clients] Menu, client name will initially be displayed in green. Once a client agrees to start the visa process, a case is created, and the lead becomes a regular client.
- **Creating Case:** Each case is created for a client for a specific type of visa and progresses through various stages until the visa is either granted or denied. Case can be created from [Cases] section.
- **Tasks & Appointments:** The [Tasks] section lets you create tasks that can be assigned to colleagues. By checking the Appointment box, a task can be converted into a client appointment. Both tasks and appointments will appear on the calendar on their scheduled dates.

## Legends

**Lead:** Client's name will show in green font until a case is created for the client.

## To be continued...

This is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of our CRM, and development is ongoing.
